# python-network-cdp-seed-crawler
Python project that aims to discover CDP neighbors and map their Layer-2 topology within a shareable medium like Visio or Draw.io. 

Enter SSH credentials, enter a 'seed' device to start CDP crawling from, and wait. There is also an SSH 'test' device you must enter - this simply tests your SSH credentials before kicking off the rest of the script.
